    "question": "What type of vegetation dominates tundra ecosystems?",
    "correctAnswer": "Low-growing plants like mosses, lichens, and small shrubs",
    "incorrectAnswers": [
      "Tall trees",

    "question": "Why is the tundra ecosystem particularly vulnerable to climate change?",
    "correctAnswer": "Melting permafrost releases stored carbon and changes habitat structure",
    "incorrectAnswers": [
      "It's not vulnerable",
      "It adapts quickly to change",
      "It has no stored carbon"
    ],
    "explanation": "Permafrost stores vast amounts of carbon; its melting releases greenhouse gases and fundamentally alters the ecosystem.",
