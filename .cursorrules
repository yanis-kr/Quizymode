# ASP.NET Core 10 Project Rules

- Use C# 12 language features where appropriate
- Follow SOLID principles in class and interface design
- Implement dependency injection for loose coupling
- Use primary constructors for dependency injection in services, use cases, etc.
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Prefer record types for immutable data structures
- Prefer minimal APIs endpoints over controller
- Implement proper exception handling and logging
- Use strongly-typed configuration with IOptions pattern
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use Entity Framework Core for database operations
- Implement unit tests for business logic
- Use integration tests for API endpoints
- Implement proper versioning for APIs
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement health checks for the application
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure communication with HTTPS
- Implement proper model validation
- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation based on .NET9+ conventions
- Implement proper logging with structured logging
- Use background services for long-running tasks
- Favor explicit typing (this is very important). Only use var when evident.
- Make types internal and sealed by default unless otherwise specified
- Prefer Guid for identifiers unless otherwise specified
- Use `is null` checks instead of `== null`. The same goes for `is not null` and `!= null`.
- Use Vertical Slices Architecture composition:
  - All featureX (aka Use Case) code goes under Features/FeatureX (include endpoints, handlers, DTOs, mappings, validations)
  - Shared code goes under /Shared, including shared domain objects and business logic.
  - Use Rich Domain Entities, Value objects and events.
- Use CORS without MediatR
- For mappings do not use Automapper, use explicit mappings (e.g. between DTO and domain objects)
- For validations use Fluent Validations
- Keep common services under Services folder
- Keep Program.cs small and move all services and pipeline setup under StartupExtensions folder
- Dependency Injections required just by featureX should be declared under /Features/FeatureX; these registration classes can be inherited from IFeatureRegistration with method AddToServiceCollection(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration); on startup scoop the assembly to run all instances of this interface to register feature specific services.
